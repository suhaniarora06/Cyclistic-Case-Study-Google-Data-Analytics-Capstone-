## Introduction

Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study project that I did for my
[Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics)!

Cyclistic is a bike-share company in Chicago that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes and about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use the bikes to commute to work each day.

Cyclisticâ€™s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders and will be the key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, they believe that there is a solid opportunity to convert casual riders into members.

## Problem Statement

This analysis aims to develop marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members. To achieve this, we need to understand how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently, why casual riders might be inclined to purchase annual memberships, and how Cyclistic can leverage digital media to influence casual riders to become members.


## Data Source

Even though Cyclistic is a fictional company, for the purposes of this case study, the datasets are appropriate and
have been made available by [Motivate International Inc.](https://motivateco.com/) under this [data agreement license](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).

The data used is representative of all bike rides from August 2023 to July 2024, reflecting the most recent information, and can be downloaded from [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).

However, due to data privacy concerns, personally identifiable information about the riders is not accessible. Consequently, we will be unable to obtain payment details or residential addresses to determine if a single rider has purchased multiple passes or to track the distance a rider lives from the Cyclistic service network.
